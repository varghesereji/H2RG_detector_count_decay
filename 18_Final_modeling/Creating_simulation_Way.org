* Create the Parameters.

** DONE Call the files of p, count and it's error

** DONE Fit the curve with a second degree polynomial and find the parameters.

** DONE Make p as a function of count

* Crearte the simulation

** TODO Make time bin dt=0.001s

** TODO Count rate is (30k/(10*10) = 300 per second. So, in each slice of time, 300*0.001

** TODO C(t) = C(t-dt)+C_r*dt - a(p(C))(exp(-b(p(C))t)-1)+Noise
